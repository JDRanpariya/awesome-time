* Notes on Time Management
** Hugh Kearns ([[http://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/node/988#the-seven-secrets][link]])
*** Learn how to say *no*, or not to say yes
- Buy yourself time.
- Give people alternatives.
- Delegate.
- Replace automatic negative thoughts/catastrophic thinking with more accurate thoughts
  (e.g. ask yourself: is this in my long term interest?)
*** Big rocks first
- Put first things first (surely not emails).
*** Selective perfectionism
- 20% of your effort will give you 80% of output: it may be enough, or
  more than enough.
- Set yourself deadlines.
*** The paradox of choice
- Too many options may paralize you: remove them.
- What is the next action? Leave yourself a note if you suspend working.
*** Big rocks are too big: split them
- Take micro/nano steps at a time.
*** Minimize interruptions
- Paperwork: either do it, diarise it, or ditch it.
- Multitasking is not efficient for single-focused tasks.
- Get rid of technology, turn off any notification, unsubscribe.
- Protect your hours of real works.
- Take advantage of early hours in the day.
- Create a concentrated environment.
*** Fight Procrastination
**** Get started
- If you wait for motivation, it may never come.
**** Allocate specific times
- If you don't put a time, it's a lie.
**** Build rewards
- Only after!
**** EXAMPLE: Writing
- Reading one more article / doing one further experiment won't make you more ready to write.
- Get a small dose of writing every day.
- Proceed by iterations.
*** Control the controllables
- Don't lose time/energy with sth you can't control.
