* Teaching Talk: Helping Students Who Procrastinate (Tim Pychyl)
** Introduction
- poem by John Lea in /Boys Own Paper/ (Vol. 37, Issue 3, Jan 1915)
  - "...and though a year was given him, the task was still undone".
- biggest problem in education
  - and amount of self-regulation required is increasing w/ online material
- sloth in religions (time is not a renewable resource)
- 95% of students affected
- we will address:
  - "it's me" (personality)
  - "it's the task" (nature of the goal)
  - "it's the way I think" (e.g. negative thinker)
  - "it's my lack of willpower" 
** What is procrastination?
- self-deceptive inner dialogue
  - "Hard work often pays off after time but laziness always pays off now."
  - "If a job is worth doing, it will still be worth doing tomorrow."
  - "By not doing what you should be doing, you could be having so much fun."
  - "This can wait."
- it's
  - all about giving in to feel good now
  - affecting our future self
  - not about having fun
- in psychology:
  - gap between intention and action
  - voluntary irrational delay despite expectation of a potential negative outcome
- all procrastination is delay, but not all delay is procrastination.
  - many things belong to tomorrow
  - sometimes we're truly really busy
- sometimes we manage our emotions by managing tasks
- it's not a time management issue
** Consequences of procrastination
- costs as
  - reduced
    - performance
    - well-being (don't feel good about ourselves)
    - health (through stress, more headaches, stomach aches, ill)
    - relationships (family, also through stress)
    - wellness behavior (eating, sleeping, exercising, getting timily treatments)
  - increased
    - regrets
    - guilt (paralizing emotion)
- procrastination is
  - usually harmful
  - sometimes harmless
  - never helpful
- has to do with emotions
  - do I feel like it or not?
** Key pieces of the self-regulation failure puzzle
- central piece: weakness of will, *self-regulation failure* (like buying stuff you cannot afford, eating more than you need, problematic gambling), giving in to feel good
  - classic negative reinforcement
    - getting rid of a negative stimulus (e.g. umbrella, cold)
      - I'm having negative emotions when I think about the task
      - if I avoid the task, I feel better
      - I reinforce it => I establish a procrastination habit
      - takes a lot of work to get rid of it
      - this is the issue, let's start here to start making changes to the habit
- *Personality* (way we're made)
  - not easy to change, stable aspect of us
  - partly genetics, partly learned
  - you won't procrastinate much if you
    - are conscientious (dutiful, self-disciplined, organized, structured)
    - are a self-oriented perfectionist (you do well for yourself)
    - have higher emotional intelligence (it's more skill-based than trait-based)
  - you're at risk of procrastination if you
    - are not conscientious
    - are impulsive (you cannot shield one intention from another)
    - are a socially-prescribed perfectionist (you live up to others' people standards)
    - have lower emotional intelligence
  - you can't push people past developmental readiness
    - prefrontal cortex is last part of our brain to develop (early adulthood to mature)
    - identity may still have to be achieved
- *Nature of our goals and intentions*
  - task aversiveness
    - nature varies depending on where you are in the project
      - at all stages: boredom, frustration, resentment
      - at inception/planning: lack of meaning (enjoyment, fun, pleasure, passion, self-identity)
      - during action: lack of structure (autonomy, control, initiation, uncertainty) (where advisors can make a difference)
  - abstract vs concrete
    - concrete => it belongs to today
    - abstract => it belongs to tomorrow
- *What we think and belief*
  - "I'm thinking I'm too stupid"
  - "I work better/only under pressure"
    - we actually make more errors
    - pathetic
    - professionals know it
    - we have to develop a different habit
  - counterfactuals
    - upward (if only I've studied longer)
    - downward (couldn't have been worse)
      - it makes you feel better
- *Self-control and willpower*
  - it is like a muscle (we just wear it out)
  - our stonenghe brain still thinks that sugar and fat are a good idea
  - need to
    - invest strategically limited resources
    - strengthen will power
** Some strategies for change
- move from anemic goal intentions (too vague) to implementation intentions
  - *in situation X, I will do behaviour Y to achieve subgoal Z*
    - when this workshop ends today, I'm going straight to the library to read 4 pages of this paper I'm struggling to read to achieve the subgoal that I need to summarize 
    - external cue for behavior is in the environment (X)
    - helps on health and work
- to the extent you can manage emotions, you can manage procrastination (no matter how I feel, I'm going to work)
  - perceive it
  - manage it ("I can have fear, I need not be my fear, because I can work from some other parts of my inner landscape.", e.g. I could work from my curiosity)
  - understand it (you're not going to have always positive emotions)
  - change it
- help people see their own self-deception and be aware of your own
- at inception stage, look for meaning; at action stage, make sure you have structure
- break it down, take baby steps, know the next step (concrete => more urgent)
- recognize when you're making excuse ("you can do it tomorrow", "it could have been worse")
- you can always find ways to motivate yourselves (e.g. money)
- meditate helps
  - attention non judgementally back to where it belongs
- ask yourself
  - is there any way I could do this now?
  - are you taking control of your life and having some sense of agency?
  - why is it important for me? (value affirmation)
- know enough
  - your own limits / time frame
  - good feeling of getting things done
  - upward spiral (little progress fuels us)
  - the moment where you exercise your self-control (choose whether you are going to work or not)
  - your emotions
- the busier you get, the more prone you'll be to get things done
- bring future self into clear vision
