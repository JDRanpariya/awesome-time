* Organize Mindfully Podcast w/ David Allen
- 5 steps to keep things under control
  - what's not under cruise control? (*capture*)
    - as long as it's not in your head
    - trusted buckets, physical intrays, record it
    - paper and pen
    - freedom of not thinking what to do about it
    - to be thrown away moving on other stages
  - what does it mean to me? why is not on cruise control?  (*clarify*)
    - what exactly do you need to do? what are you committed/committing to?
    - is it sth I am I committed to move on (actionable) or not? what outcome I'm committed to? what next action?
    - you may also delete it, file it, stage it for later review
    - key question is "what's the next action?"
    - with more things: projects
  - where do I need to *organize* it? what's the next action? where to put results?
    - sit things wherever I can find them when I need them (index of projects, list of phone calls taks when I'll be able to do phone calls, list of conversation items available where I will be talking)
    - errands
  - step back and *reflect* & review
    - don't be driven by the latest and loudest things in your head
    - orienting yourself in space & time based on contents
    - every couple of hours to check calendar
    - weekly review driven off the projects you got
      - step back and look at index
    - longer cycle review
    - quarterly/monthly
